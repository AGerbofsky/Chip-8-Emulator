This Chip-8 Emulator was put together while going through a Udemy course on implementing a Chip-8 Emulator in the C programming language. This project
provided a fantastic learning experience, a fantastic way to firmly cement classroom topics by practical application.

What I learned:
  - How to organize an emulator. That is what components connect to which and so on.
  - How to parse and execute machine opcode/instructions in C.
  - Defininately polished up my memory management, and use of pointers.
  - Gained some good experience using SDL2.
  - Became much more comfortable in managing multiple sourcefile projects.
  - Solidified Computer Architecture concepts learned in the classroom by implementing them in the "real-world".
